## Question:

Create a nice Tailwind template, with a file upload form at the center, and a left sidebar.

## Answer:

All set â€” I created a clean Tailwind HTML template in the canvas titled **"Tailwind File Upload Template (sidebar + Center)"**. Open it in the canvas to view/edit the full code (includes drag-and-drop, previews, and a left sidebar).

Want a React/Tailwind (single-file) or a version wired to an API endpoint next?
