## Question

Create a nice tailwind template, with a list of stuff, where in each entry have an x icon in the right to sign that the entry can be deleted.

## Answer

Done — I created a React + Tailwind single-file component in the canvas called **"Tailwind List With Delete (react)"**. It uses `lucide-react` for the X icon and `framer-motion` for smooth remove animations.

Would you like a plain HTML/Tailwind version, a Vue version, or extra features (confirm modal, undo, persistent storage)?

## Question 2

Give me a pure html version.

## Answer 2

All set — I replaced the canvas file with a **pure HTML + Tailwind** single-file example (includes accessible delete buttons, smooth add/remove animations, and an Add button).

Open the canvas document titled **"Tailwind List With Delete (react)"** to copy the HTML. Want me to:

* add an undo action for deletes, or
* produce a downloadable file (ZIP/HTML), or
* convert this to a Vue/Alpine.js version?
